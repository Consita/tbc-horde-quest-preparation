3.15 (2026-01-12)
- We realized 'questlog' quests didn't calculate the correct exp based on your level. Please check that your questlog quests are still good! If quests now give low exp, you need to fix it!

-- Addon will show a warning as well the first time you log in after updating

- Implemented first version of the new 'Extras - Mailbox' feature. This feature helps manage your items with your bank & mailbox, but is optional.

-- The 'Companion' can be opened from the extras tab, from '/tbcprep companion' or from the buttons added to the Mail & Bank interface.

- Implemented the 'Extras - Extra TBC Prep' feature. A selection of quests can be added to the 'Quests' tab from here, but they are not 'fully' supported everywhere. You should make sure to manage these yourself!
-- Hunters can enable their Rhok'delar class quests here.

- The 'A Bijou for Zanza' fix was lost in the 3.14b update. It's now back again ^_^
